My 7th miniproject! This is an upgraded version of the portfolio from the 6th miniproject using a few of the tricks that would have been learned since then. I happened to do too much the first time which cut down on what was necessary to do for this one. I was already happy with almost all of the styling but there were a few things that could be done to improve it. 

1. I improved all buttons and links with hover animations.  
2. I improved how various parts scaled with different screen sizes, though as I was already using flex beforehand there weren't any egregious spots beforehand.  
3. Different parts of the css is organized better and in their own asset folder.  
4. The skills section has been improved a bit to pop out. My end goal for it is to have the logos of each technology to make it look better, but that can wait until bootstrap is brought into the picture.  
5. I separated some of the project descriptions with linebreaks to make things easier to read.  
6. The contact section has been slightly improved as there were a couple mistakes last time including a typo and missing text area.
7. Some links fill out their available width better when displayed as column, which now happens for some of them on smaller screen sizes.
